## IDC 21 DAYS SQL CHALLENGE
SPONSORED BY @DPDzero

### 📘OBJECTIVE OF THE CHALLENGE
- Stay consistent and track my learning publicly.  
Each day, I’ll upload my solutions, notes, and key learnings.

Welcome to my SQL learning journey!
This repository documents my progress as I complete daily SQL cahlleneges- to improve my query skills, analytical thinking and problem solving skills.

- Programming Language: SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Database: MySQL

### KEY TAKEWAY
#### Day 1:
- How to import dataset in MySQL
- How to retrieve data using the SELECT statement
- How to retrieve specific column using SELECT statement
- How to find unique values with DISTINCT

 #### DAY 2
- Filtering data using the WHERE clause
- Combining conditions in a WHERE clause using comparison and logical operators
- Filtering data using comparison operators such as !=, >, <, <>, etc..
- Filtering data using logical operators such as AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN, IN, etc..

#### DAY 3
- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
- By default, ORDER BY sorts the data in ascending order (ASC).
- To sort the data in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
- You can also sort by multiple columns — the data is first sorted by the first column, then by the second, and so on.
